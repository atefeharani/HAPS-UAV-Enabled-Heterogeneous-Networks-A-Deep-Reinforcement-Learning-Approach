# Abstract
The integrated use of non-terrestrial network (NTN) entities such as the high-altitude platform station (HAPS) and low-altitude platform station (LAPS) has become essential elements in the space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). However, the complexity, mobility, and heterogeneity of NTN entities and resources present various challenges from system design to deployment. This paper proposes a novel approach to designing a heterogeneous network consisting of HAPSs and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being LAPS entities. Our approach involves jointly optimizing the three-dimensional trajectory and channel allocation for aerial base stations, with a focus on ensuring fairness and the provision of quality of service (QoS) to ground users. Furthermore, we consider the load on base stations and incorporate this information into the optimization problem. The proposed approach utilizes a combination of deep reinforcement learning and fixed-point iteration techniques to determine the UAV locations and channel allocation strategies. Simulation results reveal that our proposed deep learning-based approach significantly outperforms learning-based and conventional benchmark models.
